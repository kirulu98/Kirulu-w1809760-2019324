                        The term "information technology" was first used in a 1958 article in the Harvard Business Review. 
                        Harold J. Leavitt and Thomas L. Whisler are credited with coining the term to differentiate between machines specifically designed for limited functions and general-purpose computers that can be programmed for various tasks.
